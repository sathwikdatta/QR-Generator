This will redirect to chatGPT.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

**1. Create a Basic HTML Form**
We'll start by creating an HTML form where users can input the website link they want the QR code to redirect to.

**2. Generate a QR Code Dynamically**
Next, we use JavaScript to generate a QR code based on the input link. We'll utilize the index.js library for this purpose.

**3. Redirect Logic**
When the QR code is scanned, it should redirect to the input link.
